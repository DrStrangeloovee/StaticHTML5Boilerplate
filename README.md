## Why was this made?
Sometimes I don't want Node, I don't want Rails, I don't want every damn package under the sun. I just want a damn boilerplate HTML/CSS/JS package I can plop in the browser and run. Wah-la. Barebones deps., lightweight, and ready to go. If you have any suggestions for improvement please reach out.
